# Automated Conditions 5e
A small module for Foundry and Dnd5e which uses dnd5e system Hooks to add the correct config options for Rolls, trying to automate the most common Dnd5e Conditions.

# Usage
Create an effect on a token with one of the following labels:
- Blinded
- Deafened
- Exhaustion 1
- Exhaustion 2
- Exhaustion 3
- Exhaustion 4
- Exhaustion 5
- Frightened
- Invisible
- Paralyzed (or Paralysed)
- Petrified
- Poisoned
- Prone
- Restrained
- Stunned
- Unconscious

Rolling with Core, will indicate the correct button to press, on Attack Rolls, Damage Rolls, Saving Throws, Ability Checks and Skill Checks, according to the 5e ruleset.
Fast Forwarding the rolls (holding SHIFT) will roll with advantage/disadvantage or when needed critical damage correctly.

** Early stage of development so reach out either here by creating an Issue or in Foundry's discord (thatlonelybugbear#4393).

# Compatibility
Tested for core dnd5e and seems to be working fine.

MidiQOL also seems to work OK (no attribution.

I haven't tested with other rolling modules yet.

I will need to think on how to better integrate (if possible) with Monks Little Details, DFreds CE and maybe CUB, which could change default DND5e conditions.
